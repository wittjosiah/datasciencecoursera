## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation, the following
## functions allow the creation of a matrix which can cache its inverse
## removing the need to continuously calculate it

## This function creates a special matrix object which
## allows for the caching of its inverse
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  i <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    i <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() i
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}

## This function computes the inverse of the special matrix
## object. If the inverse has already been calculate and the
## matrix is unchanged the cached inverse is returned.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  i <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(i)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(i)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  i <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(i)
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  i
}
